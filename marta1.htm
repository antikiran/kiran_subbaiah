<h4>
<p>Kiran Subbaiah's recent "Antiwork" show at the Chitrakala Parishath
was one of the most interesting events that happened here in a long time.
Two halls strewn with often small, shabby looking objects gradually revealed
a whole simple-complex worldview utterly relevant to what our life is.

<p>Using crude, ready objects and contraptions. but shaping them and partly
subverting their original form and purpose, the artist conjures from those
literal as well as lyrical metaphors of human effort, emotions and condition.
There is resourceful and intelligent playfulness in his sculptural assemblage-installations
and biting, open sarcasm, including self-irony.

<p>And yet, empathy and gravity can be felt too. Although Subbaiah admits
the impossibility of attaining our aspirations, he finds aspiring itself
precious. At this point he relates simultaneously to Leonardo da Vinci's
utopian ideas, his own school-time attempts and to rough realities and
inventiveness on the basic level, locally.

<p>His concern stays as much with the nature of art as with the contradictions
inherent to ordinary existence. Whereas the onlooker has to do some thinking,
the wonder of these images is that their very raw physicality, aided by
the invitation to the spectator to handle them, to a large measure contains
both concept and expression visually. While growing from the Indian ethos,
they participate in the mechanisms of current international art in a highly
individual and genuine manner. The completeness of the impact is admirable
in particular to someone as young as Subbaiah. A central motif belongs
to the lofty but doomed wish to fly.

<p>Starting from the grand lineage, the artist places a pair of angelic
white wings made of inert, weighty ceramic. At the other end are his coat
hangers on strike. Their wires twisted bird-like or turned into heavy vegetable
silhouettes, they seem to be almost taking off or falling down. Sympathy
for deprived and incapable people intuited there becomes declared in the
piece "His Dog's Voice", where a loudspeaker tube is silenced by Ekalavyan
arrows. Throughout there runs a thread of disbelief in the apparent or
stated character of reality, which covers manipulated facts. The situation's
political aspect is hinted in the locked money collection box inside which
a "Truth" key can be seen.

<p>Daily hardships, denatured environment and elemental shortages have
inspired the works about water. There is a crushed "Full Belly" plastic
bottle and a crude bucket connected to a taps pipe in a relationship of
ineffectual dependence. A photographic cloud yields rain markings to an
actual glass measure, and a funnily ominous mushroom of dry substance emerges
from "Thirst". The conceptual stress on those works gives into more palpable
sensations when the artist focuses on desires and striving of various kinds.
<p>An immense pink tongue of rubber lies on a sugar pillow, set in a coarse
material suggestive of greedy lips in ecstasy. "Lazy Objects" - a feeble
axe or a pen resting on plump cushions -- disproportionately tiny to the
massive handles prove their powerlessness, yet are shot in glorified erect
poses.

<p>The theoretically self-perpetuating balance between a shoe and a banana
evokes the never consummate "Quest".

<p>Mischievously functioning gadgets, designed for eternal self-sufficiency
but bound to fail is another fascination here. Their intrinsically contradictory
state serves to betray pseudo heroism, as in the wooden "Lion Food" trap
which ejects a rubber mouse from inside on pulling a knob.
<p>If one tries to concretize the meaning of Subbaiah's works, it tends
to limit them, since their strength relies on a roughly lyrical expressiveness
together with wide associations. Indeed, one might agree with what his
"Articulation" implies in an entanglement of brain ropes passing limp through
the mouth spools.
