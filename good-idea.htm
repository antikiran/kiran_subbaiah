<h4>
<p>I have an idea.
<p>It is a good idea.
<p>I tell it to you because it is a good idea.
<p>It is good for you.
<p>You are convinced that the idea is good.
<p>I tell it to others.
<p>They are all convinced that it is a good idea.
<p>You and all the people I tell the idea to also tell it to others who
tell it yet again to others….
<p>Everybody is convinced that the idea is good.
<p>The idea spreads to all corners of the world and is remembered forever.
<p>But don’t forget –
<p>Don’t ever forget to tell all the people you tell the idea to that
it was I who told the idea to you.

<p>It’s MY idea.
