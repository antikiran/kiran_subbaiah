All that I have to say is that 
<p>
when there is the opportunity to express some thing... 
<p>
on an occasion like this for example,
<p>
when a reader happens to be available....
<p>
I mean, when we look at it from the right point of view - 
<p>
<p>
that is, the way we see it... 
<p>
or the way it is actually... 
<p>
or in fact, the way it appears... 
<p>
I suppose you know what I mean - 
<p>
<p>
any way, when we look at it from the right point of view,
<p>
I get this vague impression 
<p>
that it can be explained with absolute certainty, 
<p>
that the general idea of the whole point 
<p>
lies in how it can be explained for sure
<p>
that the general idea of the whole... 
<p>
<p>
I mean, since the whole point of what I'm trying to say
<p>
is to clarify the whole point of what is being said...
<p>
because I mean, for me, personally I think - 
<p>
well, this is very personal - 
<p>
but personally I think that what I think is Universal...
<p>
<p>
I mean the fact that it is absolutely important 
<p>
that it doesn't really matter... 
<p>
but since its already being taken into consideration, 
<p>
I'm not sure as to exactly how it should be explained, 
<p>
but I'm sure that you have understood.
<p>
<p>
Thank you.
