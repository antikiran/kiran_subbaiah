<h4>
All that I have to say is that 
<p>
when there is this opportunity 
<p>
to express something of significance
<p>
on an occasion like this for example
<p>
when a reader happens to be available
<p>
and it is possible to put forth
<p>
whatever one pleases
<p> 
well atleast potentially possible
<p>
to put forth whatever one pleases
<p>
I mean when we look at it 
<p>
from the right point of view
<p>
that is the way we see it 
<p>
or the way it is actually 
<p>
or may be the way it all seems to appears
<p>
I suppose you know what I mean
<p>
well anyway when I look at it 
<P>
from the right point of view
<p>
I get this rather vague impression 
<p>
that it can be explained
<p>
with absolute certainty
<p>
that the general idea of the whole point 
<p>
lies in how it can be explained for sure
<p>
that the general idea of the whole
<p>
I mean since the whole point 
<p>
of what is being said
<p>
is to clarify the whole point
<p>
of what I am trying to say
<p>
because for me personally I think that
<p>
well this is very personal
<p>
but personally I think 
<p>
that whatever I think 
<p>
is Universal
<p>
I mean the fact 
<p>
that it is absolutely important 
<p>
that it doesn't really matter
<p>
but since its already being taken into consideration
<p>
I'm not sure as to exactly how it should be explained 
<p>
but I'm sure that you understand
<p>
that you have understood
<p>
Thank you
