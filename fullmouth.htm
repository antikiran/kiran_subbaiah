<h4>
Mr. X and Mr.Y always formulate their conversations best at the dinner table because that's when they get their mouths full, and while they chew, find enough time to think about what has to be said.
<P>
"Hmm" says Mr. X "the food's quite good! isn't it?"
<P>
Mr. Y:
<br>
 Well, it's not bad, it could have been worse. Hey! you're eating with your hand again -- you barbarian!
<P>
"It's you who are the barbarian" says Mr. Y pointing at Mr.X's knife and fork "look at those weapons you use".
<P>
Mr. Y:
<br>
 You see, the advantage of eating with fork and knife is that you don't risk the chances of burning your fingers.
<P>
"The advantage of eating with your fingers" says Mr. X "is that you don't risk the chances of burning your mouth".
<P>
Mr. Y:
<br>
 Alright then, you win.
<P>
"Then you should put down your fork and knife and eat With your fingers" Mr. X says.
<P>
Mr. Y:
<br>
 Why should I? I've never burnt my mouth eating with fork and knife.
<P>
"Alright then" says Mr. X "I lose".
<P>
Mr Y:
<br>
 But you know, I once heard of somebody who cut his lip very badly while eating with fork and knife.
<P>
"Is it? Well, a friend of mine -- a very close friend of mine in fact" says Mr. X swallowing a  mouthful unchewed "he once bit off a piece of his finger while eating a gulab-jamun with his bare hands".
