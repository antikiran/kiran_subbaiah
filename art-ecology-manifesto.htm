<h4>
Dissolve distinction between artist, art and beholder.
<p>
Audiences congregate in large empty spaces to imagine their own art.
<p>
All artistic thought that takes shape in the mind, to be withheld from being expressed and reserved strictly for their author to behold.
<p>
Physicality of art practices to be restricted to contain even the slightest hint of expression.
<p>
Cultivate the morale that it is shameful to express art one imagines, and to expose oneself to art imagined by others.
<p>
Dynamic and potentially expressive forms of practice that cannot be suppressed, to be carried out in specially equipped private one-person chambers, or - when the muses strike unannounced - at the nearest bathroom mirror with door closed.
<p>
Conserve artistic resources by imagining less art.
<p>
Encourage regular congregations but with no compulsion to imagine art: Preferably imagine nothing.
<p>
Promote forgetting the essence of all art previously imagined to allow the same essence to be experienced anew.
<p>
Permit only expressions that undermine art and bear inspiration for its renunciation. Absolute and universal renunciation may never be achieved, but granting this exception would greatly benefit the art ecology.
<p>
Find practical uses for non-art conceptions that show signs of conspiracy (art infiltrating the real world in disguise). If ingenious uses cannot be assigned to a conception, mass-produce the conception as bookmark, paperweight or ashtray, in large quantities.
<p>
Remember, this is not about material ecology - Nor about a non-sustainable art ecology.
