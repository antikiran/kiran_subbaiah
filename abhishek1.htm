<p>Let it be made clear at the very outset, Kiran Subbaiah’s work is a
joke. Almost all of his artworks are performed with a sort of earnest,
deadpan seriousness that puts even the most hard-boiled irony to shame.
The fact that as a viewer, one cannot but help chuckling to one-self while
engaging with his work is perhaps only a minor part of this joke. And as
the tug of the facial muscle informs the viewer of the smile spreading
across his face, he receives instant confirmation of this nascent smile
from the work itself; the work seems to offer up a mirror for the viewer
to gaze at his own smile. Or perhaps the scenario really is of a vertiginous
regress of mirrors, where this reflected image of confirmation is really
another, perhaps virtual viewer laughing at the smile of this other ‘real’
viewer: a garrulous community of viewers, with each acutely aware of the
other.&nbsp; And somewhere among this uproar, history comes in and sits
down quietly.

<p>Consider for example, one of his earlier video works, ‘Hello, I am...’
(1997-1998) where Kiran trains the video camera on his own image in the
bathroom mirror and keeps up a uninterrupted monologue - though contextualized
in the video as a putative dialogue with the expected, or intended viewer
of the video - on the epistemological nature of the video image and the
material conditions of its production and consumption.&nbsp; A similar
monologue - albeit with some crucial differences - is performed in another
video work from the same period, ‘Reality and the Mirror’(97-98). Here,
after a brief explication on the manner in which a private space, like
a closed bathroom produces a specific kind of interiority where the enclosed
subject enjoys a complete lack of the other’s gaze on her/him self, Kiran
disrupts the narration with a sudden turn to a dramatic enactment.&nbsp;

<p>The irony and the humor in these works arise from a complex interplay
between two strategies: citation and pedagogy. Today, when an artist who
works from within the envelope of institutionalized avant-garde art practice
- Kiran’s work has been exhibited at the Apeejay Media Gallery, New Delhi,
Royal College of Art, London as well as the Rijks Akademie, Amsterdam -
makes a video piece on the mediation between the real and virtual/mechanically
reproduced image in front of a self-portrait-ish mirror, one cannot but
help recapitulate the rich and sedimented history of such a meditation.
A star cast of characters from art history cast their long shadow. To take
a random picking: Velazquez’s Las Meninas, Foucault’s brilliant unpacking
of the same, D&uuml;rer’s&nbsp; self-portraits, the long tradition of Trompe
l'oeil paintings. In a smorgasbord of references, Kiran piles them up higher,
relentlessly. In staging an act of communication within the private space
of the bathroom, isn’t he alluding to the Wittgensteinian notion of the
‘private language’ that can only enact itself as a game? Isn’t the sudden
inclusion of an arrow, a theatricalisation of the figure of the indexical
arrow - that venerable mark of deixis that bind the signifier to the signified?
Its almost as if at every screening, the real action shifts from the video
to the viewer, to the blurred lines of motion he creates as he frenetically
jumps from reference to reference.&nbsp; Perhaps the joke is on him.

<p>Or perhaps he needs to empty his mind, in classic Zen style and approach
the problem from first principles just as Kiran does in the video. Just
as one would prove a theorem in logic or geometry, Kiran’s voice traces
a pedagogic trajectory that exults in the manner a complex formulation
comes into being from simple propositions. Apart from being thoroughly
enjoyable, does this tension between citation and pedagogy also betray
the particularities of an artist’s engagement with history? How else can
one engage with history apart from recapitulating it in a manner that telescopes
that history onto ones own trajectory of development as an artist.&nbsp;

<p>The element of a binary play continues in Kiran’s Objects and Spatial
Works. (http://www.geocities.com/antikiran/3d.htm). There it reincarnates
itself as the play between functional/defunct, between action/reaction,
between cause/effect. Take for example Brakes, where 4 castors are attached
to a plastic ball. Or Discontent Content where a bucket half-filled with
water is placed under a faucet which is connected not to any external water
source but to the same bucket by a piece of actual plumbing. This absurd
reconstitution of banal&nbsp; objects that renders them dysfunctional even
as it unpacks notions of truth and value poses interesting questions: is
an object valuable when it remains true to its function? In conspicuously
abandoning its use-value does an object circumvent the utilitarian circuit
to arrive at a different realm of poesies?&nbsp;

<p>It is interesting to note that in the long inventory of objects in Kiran’s
All My Belongings project &lt;http://www.geocities.com/antikiran/amb.htm>
the very last object is an escape ladder. Exhibited at the Rijksakademie,
Amsterdam in 2002, the project put up a public display of everything that
Kiran possessed then, except for works of art or things connected to the
making of art. Each object bore a label with the name of the artist and
of the object. It might be pertinent here to revisit the penultimate proposition
(6.54) in Wittgenstein’s celebrated Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.

<p><i>My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way; anyone who
understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used
them - as steps - to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw
away the ladder after he has climbed it up.)&nbsp;</i>

<p>Kiran’s recent work with viruses &lt;http://www.geocities.com/antikiran/pseudo_virus.htm>,
&lt;http://www.geocities.com/antikiran/netart.htm> develops and extends
upon many of the thematics found in his Video and Objects/ Spatial works,
particularly the function/dysfunction problematic. Delivered as executable
programs (.exe files) these mock viruses simulate an actual virus attack
when run on a normal Windows or Macintosh computer: like some sinister
animation, a dense array of ‘scary’ events happen in quick succession.
The computers freezes, the active window splinters up, the mouse, though
alive, deposits a trail so thick with traces so as to render it invisible,
familiar elements of the operating system - dialog boxes, radio buttons
etc - show up as mutilated ghosts. And all this unfolds to the accompaniment
of periodic shrieks from the computer.&nbsp;

<p>A malicious computer virus is that classic dweller of the liminal space
between function and dysfunction:&nbsp; its entire function is geared towards
draining out all use-value from a computer, to render it dysfunctional
(in various degrees). Also for someone who has been consistently engaging
with objects and their (dys)functionality, this intense concentration on
the interface is perhaps expected. Today, if we look around our homes,
we see an increasing array of objects getting ‘contaminated’ with the digital.
Consequently, the formal attributes of an object are no longer tethered
to its putative function. When it’s the same digital chip that controls
the clock as well as the microwave, what defines the object formally are
not cog-wheels or heating coils but its interface - the functional surface
it offers its users for manipulation and control. We could possibly parody
McLuhan and say, ’the interface is the object’.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>However, what is more interesting is the ambivalent nature of the simulation.
Even though we know that these viruses are not for ‘real’ - its just a
harmless prank - our entire experience of this desktop theater is shot
through with a palpable anxiety. Perhaps for those mildly disquieting moments
the desktop transforms into a television of catastrophe: portraying not
a distant genocide, but performing a catastrophe where the self and the
other are brought in uncomfortable proximity. It might be different however,
for the intrepid hacker. He has already looked at the source code (which
Kiran makes available) and so, instead of anxiety he is only mildly amused,
nonchalant even, as one would be while watching the drawing room aquarium.
Perhaps Kiran seems to suggest a more spectacular way of disposing of ones
junk data. Instead of consigning it to the utilitarian Recycle Bin/ Trash
Can why not submit it to the imagined charms of a ‘data aquarium’ and watch
its endless disintegration?

<p>Such, then is the ineffable charm of Kiran Subbaiah’s work. Visit his
site, to indulge in it further. You could even download an image or two
for that gentle touch of the absurd on your desktop. Pass it around friends.
Kiran swears by CopyLeft. I am sure he wouldn’t mind.&nbsp;
