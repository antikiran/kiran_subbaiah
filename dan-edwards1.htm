<p>Flight Rehearsals (2003), by Indian artist Kiran Subbaiah, draws more
on the traditions of Surrealist cinema than the conceptual tropes of most
video art. The work is a highly amusing meditation on the way our ordering
of time contains and constricts our imaginative compulsion to flights of
fancy. Beginning with an image of the artist sitting on a table, Subbaiah
relates in a droll voiceover his attempts to learn how to fly. Practising
only in the early hours of the morning to avoid being "discouraged by the
interrogation of responsible people", he discovers the secret of flight,
which involves jumping into the air as high as possible and then jumping
again before "gravity has time to act." Naturally, his ability to fly brings
an understanding of the language of birds, including the dawn crow of the
neighbourhood cock.
<p>With the coming of morning, Subbaiah’s flight is framed by a television
screen and we track back into a looking-glass bedroom. A cooked chicken
sits atop the television. An alarm clock rings and Subbaiah comes crashing
to his bed in the extreme foreground. Initially, the clock appears to be
next to him. However, when Subbaiah rises and walks over to stop the alarm,
it becomes a very large clock at the back of the room. It’s difficult to
convey in words the clever distortion of our sense of space. As Subbaiah
turns off the alarm, his dream of flight on the television disintegrates
into visual static. He turns the TV off, picks up a smouldering cigarette
and takes a rueful puff.
<p>Superficially Mirror Worlds’ most overtly comic and whimsical work,
Flight Rehearsals is a complex interrogation of the relationship between
our dreams and their literalisation in mass-produced moving images. It’s
also an entertaining narrative, a surreal depiction of the mind’s ability
to conjure images of the impossible, and a deadpan comment on the way the
conditions of modern life delimit our ability to creatively and intellectually
take flight.
<p>Although more overly filmic than the rest of Mirror Worlds, Flight Rehearsals
confirms the impression that the avant-garde of the moving image is now
to be found in the gallery rather than the cinema. In an age in which the
image is increasingly utilised to convey simplistic, one-dimensional messages
of hatred, fear or consumerist pleasure, video provides a crucial means
by which artists can intercede, interrogate and reflect upon our highly
mediated global landscape. Small quibbles like chronic sound spillage aside,
curators Zoe Butt and Bec Dean are to be praised for expanding the Australian
Centre of Photography’s already broad ambit and exposing Sydneysiders to
the work of our region’s artists in this most vital of contemporary forms.
