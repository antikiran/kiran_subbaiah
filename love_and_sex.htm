<h4>
Love felt she loved Sexy Sex
<br>
Deep from her heart, but
<br>
Sex seemed like he only wanted 
<br>
To have sex with Lovely Love.
<p>

Now Love didn’t quite like that, 
<br>
And she refused to have sex with Sex
<br>
Till Sex could somehow come someday
<br>
To truly love Love.
<p>

Sex said 'Love, listen,
<br>
That’s impossible for me to do!
<br>
How can I tell my love is true
<br>
Without having had sex with you?'
<p>

Love shook her head and said 'No Sex' and she
<br>
Nodded and said 'It's something you can do.
<br>
If I can love you without having had sex with you-
<br>
Why can’t you too?'
<p>

Sex realized Love had a point there
<br>
He said 'Hey Love I think I do too,
<br>
For I wouldn't really care to have sex
<br>
With anybody else but you.'
<p>

Love was happy to hear that
<br>
But she said 'Lets give it some time'
<br>
And Sex came back that very night
<br>
To declare that he'd made up his mind.
<p>

He sang 'Love it's true, I do love you,
<br>
I can prove it right away too
<br>
If only you let me have sex with you
<br>
Ooo wuhoo hoo!'
<p>

So they discussed the matter through the night
<br>
and till the break of dawn couldn’t pin down the flaw-
<br>
Did it lie in the social contract
<br>
Or was it caused by nature's law?
<p>

It didn't really matter which came first 
<br>
The ceremony or the act,
<br>
But Love and Sex had a baby
<br>
And that remains a matter of fact.
<p>
 
So they lived together for the rest of their lives,
<br>
Sex and Love as man and wife
<br>
Feelings were felt and deals were dealt
<br>
Somehow or another the promise was kept.
<p>

I don't know but I believe people say,
<br>
That once in a while their hearts did stray-
<br>
All those lovely women Sex couldn't take his eyes off
<br>
And men like me love couldn't keep her mind off.
<p>

Whether things really happened nobody knows
<br>
And if I did, mum's my word
<br>
But there's one thing I can say for sure:
<br>
Love and Sex were never divorced.
<p>

I was stepping out of an Internet café one day
<br>
When they happened to pass by my way
<br>
Love and Sex, arm in arm.
<p>

I couldn't really tell if it were a spell or a charm
<br>
That made my heart stop and my spine tingle.
<br>
It was one of those rare moments
<br>
When I regretted being single.
