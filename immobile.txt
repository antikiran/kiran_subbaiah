Mr. X was drumming on his briefcase to give vent to his impatience. The double-decker bus he'd boarded was caught up in a traffic jam. 

He looked at his watch. He brushed it against his sleeves and looked at it again. He smiled with satisfaction. It was a new watch. It looked real cool. It better look cool. He'd paid a bomb for it. Had he paid too much? He examined it in detail again. The dials, the key, the band-links, the latch, band-links, key, the dials. His smile faded. He'd noticed the time. It was late.

He looked with embarrassment to see if the guy next to him had seen him looking at his watch like that. The guy hadn't. He was reading a newspaper. Mr. X took a peek at the news. Ah, that was exactly what he wanted to read about! The guy turned the page.

Then Mr. X tried drumming on his brief case again. It didn't help. Then he tried sitting still. It didn't help either. Then he opened his brief case, took out his mobile phone and dialed a number. 

He couldn't get through. He tried again. The line was still busy. After a few more attempts he gave up and put the phone back in his brief case. 

Just when he slammed his briefcase shut, the phone began to ring. Mr. X opened the brief case again, and took out the phone to receive the call.

"Hello?.... Ah! So its you Mr. Y.... Well actually I tried calling your number just a moment ago.... Oh! is that so? you too?.... Well obviously then, that's why I couldn't get through.... Me, well I'm on my way to Mr. Z's place, there's a party there this afternoon.... Oh, is that so, that's good.... So I'll be seeing you there soon.... Well, I don't know because I'm already on a bus heading there but we're stranded in the middle of a traffic jam, its terrible you know.... Oh, you too?... I know.... It's quite common these days at this hour.... That's true.... I think its because more people can afford to have their own cars now that we are having all this trouble.... Yes... exactly, its prosperity that's ruining our city.... Ha ha ha!.... Well yes, I am coming straight from work.... No, but I think it was wiser not to have gone home first.... No, because if I did, I would probably never reach the party!.... What about you?.... Oh! So that's close by.... And where's your bus caught up now?.... Oh! that's very, very close by.... Me?  Well I'm on number 18.... Oh that's impossible! Say, is it a double-decker?.... Ah, then you must be sitting down stairs! Come upstairs, there are a few empty seats here!"

The guy next to Mr. X got up and took another seat. Mr. Y came up and took his place. 

Mr. X and Mr. Y grumbled about the traffic some more. 

Then they could not think of anything else to say. So Mr. Y began reading a book.

Mr. X resumed drumming on his brief case.
