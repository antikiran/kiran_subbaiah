<p>
<h4>
<p>Questioning the credentials of the Great, the young genius set out exploring
into the obscure and with his brilliance brought to light the glories of
the most trivial ever that he could discover.
<p>Retiring from his toils he declared his regrets, and with the earnest
modesty that geniuses always have, he apologized for having neglected the
greater portion of the world that lay right beneath his nose, i.e., all
that that exists between the Great and the trivial.
<p>We however need not bother about his regrets, because we (you, me and
most other people) are after all lay men and women who get to read about
things like this at a moment of leisure.
