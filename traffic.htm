The humiliation of possessing powers that we seldom get to use -- the daily routine of having to drive a fast car through traffic jams for example. This auto-accessory can keep drivers from going mad.
<p>
In the place of windscreens, cars should be fitted with video monitors and dual mode controls. 
<p>
MODE 1: The screen shows real time display of the view seen by a video cam fixed in front of the car, like as though the driver was looking through a windscreen. Driving controls function normally.

<br>
<i>mode 1</i>
<p>
<br>&nbsp;
MODE 2: The screen works as a monitor for a race-track play station. All controls of the car are disabled from their original function and turn into controls for the video game.

<p>
<br>&nbsp;
Each time the car is caught up in a traffic jam and ceases to move, the car switchs to MODE 2. The driver can now drive as fast and recklessly as he wants on the play station. When the vehicle in front is sensed moving forward, the game pauses and the car switches to MODE 1. The driver now drives normally. 
<p>
The game resumes at the next traffic jam.
