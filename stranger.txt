


Dear Stranger,


No greetings.

Like the others we'll sit here for a while

ignoring each other -

this is no meeting.

And it isn't particularly interesting

being here

for the sake of getting elsewhere,

we're waiting.


You read the newspaper

I'll nod to acknowledge sounds emitted by earphones.

Each shall take care to look at the other

while the other isn't looking.

You assert my anonymity; I'll maintain yours.

For further examination there's a reflection on the window.

It isn't particularly uninteresting

either,

being here

for the sake of going elsewhere.
